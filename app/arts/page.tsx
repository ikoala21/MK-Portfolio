        <p><i>
        Every art piece, just like many life situations, constitutes a unique and unrepeatable moment. 
        Each feeling is different every time, and one who makes it will share an instant that will never happen again. 
        Each experience is an “Ichi-go ichi-e moment,” that one can treasure as something that occurs "once in a lifetime". </i></p>
        
        <p><b> Prologue</b></p>
          <p><i>
          Its not the beginnings or the end that shapes us the person we are,
          its the in-betweens… because they are the roller-coaster of emotions - sad, happy, anxious, depressed, heartbroken, hope. 
          And forever the question of what-ifs, all these emotions portray the beauty of the process, and the time it takes. 
          To able to cherish those in-betweens is all my art collection will be about - “ichi-go ichi-e”.
